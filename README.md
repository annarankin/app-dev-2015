# Developing a SPA in 2015
_jQuery and Backbone, with Bootstrap_

Intro

## Getting set up

1. Make a new dir and touch `index.html`
2. Copy the script tags for [jQuery](https://releases.jquery.com/) & [Backbone](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/backbone.js/tutorials) from the CDN; paste into head of index page
3. Create a new `main.js`, add script tag to HTML
   1. Make sure to include it _after_ jQuery & Backbone so you can reference those in your code
4. Create a new `main.css`, add link tag
5. Open up `index.html` in your browser and prepare to refresh a lot
   1. (I use python's simple HTTP server to serve my index locally: `$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer`. Now it's `$ python3 -m http.server`)
